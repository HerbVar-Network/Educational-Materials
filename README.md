# Educational-Materials
Welcome to the HerbVar Education space!  This space is for storage and sharing of HerbVar-related educational materials.
Our goals are to create and share
1. teaching materials that use the HerbVar dataset and/or data acquision protocols
2. materials for teaching about variance and the role of variance in ecological and evolutionary processes in general
3. a community of people to support each other in teaching about these things.

Here you will find teaching materials shared by members of this group, and an email list of members.

If you have questions, or want to join the email list, contact Nora Underwood (nunderwood@bio.fsu.edu)
